Basic configuration
===================================

Setting parameters
----------------------
Cactool allows for the customisation of various parameters.

As an example, you could configure Cactool to run on port number 8080 by executing the following

.. code-block:: bash

  cactool set port 8080

On some systems, this may be

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m set port 8080

More information is given in the :doc:`Configuration <advanced-configuration>` section.
