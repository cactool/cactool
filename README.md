# Introduction
Cactool is a platform developed for researchers to collaboratively and manually code pre-existing datasets of social media posts for content and discourse analysis. After the initial setup, getting started is easy: import a csv of social media URLs; set your coding variables; and grant access to your coders who can get started right away.
 
- **No more coding via spreadsheets** Coding is undertaken via your browser (tested working on Chrome, Firefox, Edge, & Safari) with posts visible as they would be on the social media platform. This allows your coders to evaluate social media content in their native format.
- **Simple Import and Export** Take your pre-existing social media URLs from software such as [4Cat](https://github.com/digitalmethodsinitiative/4cat), [NodeXL]( https://www.smrfoundation.org/nodexl/), or API Scrapers such as [Tweepy]( https://www.tweepy.org/) and import them as a CSV list. When done, you can export your data via CSV to whatever analysis software you desire.
- **Works for multiple social media platforms** Cactool currently works with URLs from Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, & TikTok.
- **Manage Multiple Datasets** Want to split your project by source/themes? You can manage multiple concurrent datasets at the same time.
- **Built for collaboration** Cactool comes pre-packaged with user management; codes attributed are attributed to each coder for coder reliability calculation (such as [ReCal](http://dfreelon.org/utils/recalfront/)). Multiple people can be coding at the same time without sharing documents. No need to worry about version control or splitting up data.
- **Code on the Go** Cactool is mobile friendly and can be accessed remotely (we recommend using a VPN to connect, see our tutorial for why). This provides researchers interested in social media content and spaciality new avenues of research.
